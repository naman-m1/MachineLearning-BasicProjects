# MachineLearning-BasicProjects

This contains many basic projects of the Topic from Supervised and Unsupervised learning. 
It deals with the basic how to import a ceratin a library and to further fir the data and predict the best possible output.

# Important Guidelines

1.These code could be run in any i pyhton console.

2.Code is written in python v3.6 and sklearn v0.20.1 . So versions of atleast these or higher are recommended.

# Method

In every project we follow steps

1.Import the library and the data.

2.Divide the data into the training ,Cross Validation and Testing set.

3.Fit the training data to the imported model.

4.Predict the model.

5.Check the accuracy score with the testing data.
